          <h1>This is me...</h1>
          <p>
            Life has always been an up hill climb, growing up in the city of Queens New York. At the age of 18 I found myself working in customer service, 
which I enjoyed. I later realized how much I loved science and computers which led me to be the first man in my family to graduate from college. 
I graduated with an applied sciences degree for the medical field. Specializing in the cardio-pulmonary system. I love it's technicality as well 
as the fast pace, high stress of having to perform accurately to save a life. I truly enjoyed the interaction with the family and patients I had 
the privelage to take care of. I was able to work with advanced technology and high powered computers that assisted in ventilation when patients 
could no longer breathe for themselves, I was able to make adjustments to the ventilator through programming, delivering specifications that 
allowed the patient to improve until they were able breathe on there own.

		  <h1>Why I love what I do.</h1>
          <p class="dark">
		  Being in this area of the medical field made me curious about the programming and design development of these technologies, and how they operated 
and were created. As I continued my quest in learning these details I unearthed a even deeper passion about creating and developing. Noticing I 
wanted to become more involved in the programming and development of computers and websites. Understanding, this can be another up hill battle like 
the first half of my life I made a promise to keep positive even when things became difficult, and that being passionate about something means 
never giving up. Knowing the languages of computer science can be difficult to say the least I continued staying the course leading me to this 
exciting and dream fulfilling career in website development, design and programming. This has been a dream come true and I look forward to 
building long lasting  creations to help others realize there dreams.
